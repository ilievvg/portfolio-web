            I have a strong understanding of HTML, especially in using semantic
            tags, structuring web pages, and organizing elements efficiently.
            I'm confident in embedding images, links, lists, tables, and
            creating layouts using `div` and `section`. I'm comfortable working
            with attributes like `id`, `class`, `alt`, `href`, and `target`. I
            also have a good grasp of multimedia elements such as embedding
            videos and audio. However, I still need to improve my knowledge of
            HTML forms — particularly in structuring them properly, using
            `label`, `fieldset`, different `input` types, and applying HTML5
            form validation.

            I have a solid understanding of CSS and can style web pages using
            colors, spacing, fonts, and layout techniques like Flexbox. I'm able
            to create responsive designs and apply custom styles effectively.
            However, I need to improve my code organization — avoiding repeated
            class definitions, writing cleaner and more structured CSS, and
            learning more about effects and animations to enhance interactivity
            and user experience.

            I have excellent skills in Figma, including designing clean and
            responsive UI layouts, working with components, auto layout, and
            design systems. I'm confident in creating prototypes, wireframes,
            and high-fidelity mockups that follow modern design principles. I
            can collaborate efficiently using Figma's team features and version
            control. While my knowledge is advanced, I can still improve in
            using advanced plugins and optimizing design workflow for larger
            projects.

            I have a basic understanding of Webflow and can create simple
            websites using pre-built layouts and elements. I’m familiar with the
            interface and know how to style elements, adjust layouts, and
            publish a live site. As a beginner, I still need to improve my
            skills in building custom interactions, using CMS collections, and
            fully understanding responsive settings and class structure within
            Webflow.

            I have a strong understanding of WordPress, including installing
            themes and plugins, customizing layouts, and managing content
            through the dashboard. I'm confident in building and maintaining
            websites using page builders like Elementor and can handle basic
            troubleshooting. I also understand how to optimize site performance
            and manage users and settings. To improve further, I want to deepen
            my knowledge of theme customization using code and learn how to
            develop custom plugins.
