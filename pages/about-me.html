          <h3>More About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I'm Gligor Iliev, a curious and motivated beginner in web
            development, born and raised in the peaceful village of Pirava. Life
            in a small village has taught me to value patience, simplicity, and
            the beauty of learning things slowly but surely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though I'm still at the beginning of this journey, I’ve already
            discovered how exciting it feels to create something with your own
            hands — or in this case, with code. My first steps were through HTML
            and CSS, and from there I started to explore tools like Webflow,
            WordPress, and Figma to expand my creativity and understanding of
            web design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of the computer screen, I enjoy gaming, football, cycling,
            and watching movies — activities that keep me balanced and inspired.
            I believe every passion adds a little something to how I approach
            design and problem solving.
          </p>

            This portfolio is a reflection of my first real attempt at building
            something on my own. It's not perfect, but it's honest — and every
            line of code I write gets me closer to who I want to become: a
            developer who never stops learning, growing, and dreaming.
